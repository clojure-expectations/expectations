# expectations

> because less is more

expectations is a minimalist's testing framework

 *  simply require expectations and your tests will be run on JVM shutdown.
 *  what you are testing is inferred from the expected and actual types
 *  stacktraces are trimmed of clojure library lines and java.lang lines
 *  focused error & failure messages

## Credit

Expectations is based on clojure.test. clojure.test is distributed under the Eclipse license, with
ownership assigned to Rich Hickey.

## Installing
----------

The easiest way to use expectations in your own projects is via
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Add the
following dependency to your project.clj file:

    [expectations "1.2.1"] ; clojure 1.2
    [expectations "1.3.3"] ; clojure 1.3

To build expectations from source, run the following commands:

    lein deps
    lein jar

## Getting Started

By default the tests run on JVM shutdown, so all you need to do is run your clj file and you should see the expectations output. 

You can test that everything is working correctly by using
expectations in a simple test.

<pre>(ns simple.test
  (:use expectations))

(expect nil? nil)</pre>

(assuming you've put your dependencies in a (relatively pathed) lib dir)

Running your clj should be similar to:
`java -cp "lib/*" clojure.main -i /path/to/your/simple/test.clj`

At this point you should see output similar to:

<pre>Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions in 5 msecs
0 failures, 0 errors.</pre>

You can run the examples in expectations with:
`java -cp "lib/*" clojure.main -i /path/to/expectations/test/clojure/success/success_examples.clj`

You can also run expectations using lein if you install [lein-expectations](https://github.com/gar3thjon3s/lein-expectations).
Use [lein-autoexpect](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-autoexpect) to automatically
run when your Clojure source changes.

You're now ready to start using expectations as you see fit. There's
not a ton of syntax; however, you'll probably want to take a quick
look at the various ways you can write expectations.
